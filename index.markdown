Ultimately, CLUB-LEDGER is an open-source system for tokenising participation in clubs - organisations of people with a common purpose or interest.

First though, CLUB-LEDGER is seeking to revolutionise customer loyalty programs.

CLUB-LEDGER does this by placing the customer, with just one wallet, at the centre of their family of retailer programs.

The retailer, on the other hand, will enjoy a deeper conversation with their customers because they can reward reviews, surveys, votes, and other interactions with easily transferable tokens.
